DONE:
1. Error Handling: There is no visible mechanism for handling errors, such as try/catch blocks or explicit error
   return types. A standard library must be able to manage and report failures (e.g., invalid input, calculation
   errors) without crashing the program.

DONE:
2. File I/O: No functions for reading or writing files are shown. This is the most significant omission. A standard
library is incomplete without the ability to interact with the filesystem.

DONE:
3. Advanced Data Structures: The language lacks a built-in map or dictionary type (key-value store). This is a
fundamental data structure for a vast range of applications and algorithms.

NOT DONE:
4. Standard Interfaces or Protocols: There is no way to define interfaces or protocols. This makes it difficult to
write generic code. For example, you couldn't write a single sort function that works on any sortable type; you
would have to write a specific function for each data type.
